# Pokemon API

A webscraping project to provide a simple API for Pokemon information. 

## Motivation

This project is meant to be a quick project to experiment with using MongoDB, Sanic, and Celery for SpimArena later. I might also return to this later to create some code generation to see how difficult it would be to make it easier to develop applications in Rust for pokemon.
