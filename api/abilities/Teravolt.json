  "ability_name": "Teravolt",
  "effect": "Teravolt prevents a target's ability from affecting moves that the Teravolt Pokémon uses. It only affects abilities that change the power, accuracy or other effects of moves.
For example, Zekrom would be able to hit Gengar (having Levitate) using a Ground-type move like Earthquake. However, using Dragon Claw against a Pokémon with Aftermath would still receive HP loss as Aftermath did not affect the Dragon Claw attack itself.",
  "description": "Moves can be used on the target regardless of its Abilities."
