  "ability_name": "Sand Veil",
  "effect": "Sand Veil raises the ability-bearer's evasion by 20% in a sandstorm. It also gives immunity to sandstorm damage (if they are not already protected by being Ground/Rock/Steel type).
If a Pokémon with Sand Veil is the leading party Pokémon while travelling in a sandstorm, wild Pokémon are only half as likely to appear.",
