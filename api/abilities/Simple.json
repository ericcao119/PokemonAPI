  "ability_name": "Simple",
  "effect": "The Simple ability doubles the number of stages of all stat changes. Stats can be raised to a maximum of +6 stages each, or lowered to a minimum of -6 stages each.
For example, using Swords Dance would increase the Pokémon's attack by 4 stages instead of the usual 2. If Tail Whip was targeted at a Pokémon with Simple, its Defense would drop 2 stages instead of 1.
The move Simple Beam can change a Pokémon's ability to Simple.
In Generation 4, Simple doubles the effects of stat changes but does not increase the actual number of stages. Stat increases are capped at the same multiplier of ×4, as per the table below. However, the resulting effect is exactly the same as current games.",
  "description": "The stat changes the Pokémon receives are doubled."
