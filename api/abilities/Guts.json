  "ability_name": "Guts",
  "effect": "Guts raises the ability-bearer's Attack by 50% when inflicted by a major status ailment (poison, burn, paralysis, freeze or sleep). If burnt, the Pokémon does not suffer the usual drop in Attack.
All other effects of the status condition remain, e.g. losing HP each turn (poison, burn), speed drop (paralysis) or being unable to attack (paralysis, freeze, sleep).",
  "description": "It’s so gutsy that having a status condition boosts the Pokémon’s Attack stat."
