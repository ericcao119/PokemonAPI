  "ability_name": "Pickup",
  "effect": "When another Pokémon on the field uses a single-use held item, a Pokémon with Pickup will obtain the used item (if they are not already holding anything) and it can be used again.
Pokémon with Pickup will also obtain an item thrown at them with Fling (if they are not already holding anything).
In Generations 3-4, Pickup has no effect in battle.
When a battle ends, any party Pokémon with Pickup has a 10% chance of picking up an item (if they are not already holding an item).
Items picked up range from Potions, Great Balls, Ultra Balls and Rare Candies up to Leftovers and some TMs. Better items have a lower chance of being found; furthermore, higher-level Pokémon will obtain better items.",
  "description": "The Pokémon may pick up the item an opposing Pokémon used during a battle. It may pick up items outside of battle, too."
