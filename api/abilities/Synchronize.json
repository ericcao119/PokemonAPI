  "ability_name": "Synchronize",
  "effect": "If the opponent causes a burn, paralysis, or poisoning of a Pokémon with Synchronize, the opponent receives the status condition too. Self-inflicted status conditions (for example through the use of an item) are not passed on.
In Generations 3-4, bad poison is only passed on as regular poison.
If a Pokémon with Synchronize is the leading party Pokémon, there is a 50% chance of each wild Pokémon encountered having the same nature.",
  "description": "The attacker will receive the same status condition if it inflicts a burn, poison, or paralysis to the Pokémon."
