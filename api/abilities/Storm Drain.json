  "ability_name": "Storm Drain",
  "effect": "Storm Drain forces all single-target Water-type moves - used by any other Pokémon on the field - to target this Pokémon, and with 100% accuracy. The ability is most useful in double/triple battles.
When hit by the move, it deals no damage to the ability-bearer but raises its Special Attack by one stage. Stats can be raised to a maximum of +6 stages each.
Storm Drain will activate for an Water-type Hidden Power, but not Water-type Judgment.
The ability is overridden by other Pokémon becoming the center of attention from the moves Follow Me or Rage Powder.
In Generation 4, Storm Drain did not increase Special Attack nor give immunity to Water-type attacks. It also did not activate for Hidden Power.",
  "description": "Draws in all Water-type moves. Instead of being hit by Water-type moves, it boosts its Sp. Atk."
