  "ability_name": "Mold Breaker",
  "effect": "Mold Breaker prevents a target's ability from affecting moves that the Mold Breaker Pokémon uses. It only affects abilities that change the power, accuracy or other effects of moves.
For example, a Haxorus with Mold Breaker would be able to hit a Gengar (having Levitate) using a Ground type move like Earthquake. Ground type moves would still not affect Flying types.
However, if Dragon Claw KOs a Pokémon with Aftermath, a Mold Breaker Pokémon would still lose HP as Aftermath did not affect the Dragon Claw attack itself.",
  "description": "Moves can be used on the target regardless of its Abilities."
